Implementation of list ADT including functions useful for
list-based implementations of merge-sort and quick sort.

You have been provided a couple of utility functions in io.c (header
file io.h) which you are free to use.

The function read_ints reads a sequence of integers from standard
input and stores them in a linked list which is then returned.  It 
behave according to the specifications of the assignment.

The function print_and_destroy simply displays the contens of a list
and then destroys (frees) it.

You have also been provided with an implementation of merge-sort
using the list ADT for reference (file:  msort.c)

The given makefile has a target for msort (the executable result of
compiling msort.c).

You will need to add a target for qsort.
